# radio-proxy
node.js proxy server for streaming shoutcast / icecast style audio and passing now-playing info to clients via socket.io

This is still an early POC.  I'll write a proper readme once the project is closer to completion.

TODO
* Deploy to Heroku
* Configure GH Actions pipeline
* Finish TODO comments throughout the code
* Refactor as necessary
* Configure linting via `standard`
